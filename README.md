# FAKE NEWS DETECTION SYSTEM
Analysed a dataset to predict whether a news is "Fake" or "Real".
- Used PorterStemmer for Stemming and applied CountVectorizer for Bag of Words representation. Trained using Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier model with a Test Accuracy score of 90.14%.
- Used WordNetLemmatizer for Lemmatization and applied TfidfVectorizer for Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) representation. Trained using Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier model with a Test Accuracy score of 88.36%.
- Used PorterStemmer for Stemming and applied WordEmbedding for featurewise representation. Trained using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model with a Test Accuracy score of 91.47%.
- Used PorterStemmer for Stemming and applied WordEmbedding for featurewise representation. Trained using Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network model with a Test Accuracy score of 90.98%.
