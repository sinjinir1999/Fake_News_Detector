# FAKE NEWS DETECTOR
Analysed a dataset to predict whether a news is "Fake" or "Real".
1. Used PorterStemmer for Stemming and applied CountVectorizer for Bag of Words Model. Used Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier model with a Test Accuracy of 90.14%.
2. Used WordNetLemmatizer for Lemmatization and applied TfidfVectorizer for Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) Model. Used Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier model with a Test Accuracy score of 88.36%.
3. Used PorterStemmer for Stemming and applied WordEmbedding for featurewise representation. Used Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model with a Test Accuracy of 91.47%.
4. Used PorterStemmer for Stemming and applied WordEmbedding for featurewise representation. Used Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network model with a Test Accuracy of 90.98%.
